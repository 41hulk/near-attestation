## 🌈 About
Attestations play a crucial role in establishing trust in the digital world. In the absence of physical interaction or presence, it can be difficult to verify the information. Attestations provide third-party validation and secure confirmation of the authenticity of the information, making it easier for others to trust and rely on it.
